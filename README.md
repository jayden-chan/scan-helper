# scan-helper

I recently purchased an Epson V600 Scanner so I could digitize all my paper documents.
This tool is a little REPL that makes the process of scanning, naming, and compiling the
documents much faster. The biggest bottleneck in the scanning process now is loading the
paper into the scanner.
